The code is designed to classify disaster-related tweets as either real or fake using NLP and machine learning techniques. The process involves loading data, preprocessing text, tokenizing, training a machine-learning model, and evaluating its performance. Some of the main functionalities are data loading, preprocessing, model selection and training, and evaluation and visualization. Data loading and preprocessing essentially load the training and test dataset from CSV files and preprocessing cleans the text by converting to lowercase and removing newline characters to standardize the input data. Tokenization consists of tokenizing the data and ensuring each tweet is represented as tokens of consistent length. Evaluation and visualization evaluate the trained model on the validation set, while visualization displays a confusion matrix to represent the results.
